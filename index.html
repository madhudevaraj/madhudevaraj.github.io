               <span class="image main"><img src="images/img3.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300"/></span>
               <p>I completed my Master's in Computer Science at George Washington University in May 2019.
                  My unending fascination for developing computer applications led me to focus on a career in Computer Science. In my position as a Software Engineer in Micro Focus and Cognizant, I learnt the importance of meeting deadlines, creating quality applications and rigors of the software industry. I was awarded &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> <b>Performer of the year</b> in Cognizant for 2015-16.
               </p>
                <p>During my final year of engineering, I founded <b>Apti-LITe Sigma</b>, a non-profit start-up where I taught Computer Science and Mathematics to about 300 undergrads. "Knowledge parted is knowledge gained" has been my motto in life. I have always been inquisitive about exploring new technologies and finding alternative ways to solve problems. I am flexible, quick to pick up new skills and eager to learn from others.</p>
               <p>I believe that my involvement in various projects, academic strengths demonstrated through a <b>3.74 GPA</b> and work experience of <b>4+ years</b> at Micro Focus and Cognizant have helped me gain the skills required by the IT industry</p>
